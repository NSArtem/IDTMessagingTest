# IDT Messaging Test Assignment

## Tasks
* Write a function which takes a string as argument and returns the string reversed. For example, "abcdef" becomes "fedcba". Do not use the reverse method. Does it work with emojis?

* Explain what happens when the following code is executed (ARC being disabled in the compiler):

`MyClass *myClass = [[[[MyClass alloc] init] autorelease] autorelease];`

* Pick one of the following:

* * Make an app that pulls weather forecast data for the user's current location, from http://openweathermap.org/ , and displays it nicely. The app doesn't need to look very fancy. You also need to sign up for a free licence key. (You don't need to submit the key, we have our own.)

* * Make an app that listens to ambient audio using the iOS deviceâ€™s microphone and displays the average frequency of ambient sound. Discuss the algorithms you used to accomplish this.

* * Implement a UDP echo server on a desktop OS & programming language of choice (eg. some unix + python) and a UDP echo client (with UI!) for iOS to test your echo server.
